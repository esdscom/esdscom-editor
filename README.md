# esdscom-editor

The esdscom-editor project is an open source development effort aimed at giving companies an editor toolset for importing, updating and exporting DatasheetFeeds (called Document Sets in the app) among their business partners.

This project is in its infancy (pre-pre-Alpha!) and under active development. 

The project is based on the .Net Blazor Web Assembly (WASM) project type. The Blazor WASM technology is quite new but seems well-suited to document editing use cases.

The editor uses the latest version of the eSDSComXML standard (5.4), the latest set of phrases and a subset of substances downloaded from ECHA.
